# Klubhouse Gig Board
The Klubhouse Gig Board is a place where users can post listings seeking live entertainment for events. This app has the capability of logging in, creating a listing (by filling out a form), updating, and deleting your posts. 

The Klubhouse Gig Boardâ€™s ultimate purpose is for entertainers to then surf through the potential job opportunities and contact the poster about filling the position!
